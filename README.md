### TODO
- requirements.txt?
- errors
  - capture and return stderr instead of printing it to console
  - actually have error handling
- improve help menu
- auto capture what user implant is running as
  - need some logic for if windows or linux here
  - maybe make implant class instead of using a buncha vars
- figure out packaging this as standalone
- persistence?
- add command to kill implant
- is there a length limit to the command that can be passed thru the bot? just the standard discord msg limit?
